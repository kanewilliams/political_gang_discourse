# Political Party Gang Discourse Project
Completed as part of a [DIGI405](https://courseinfo.canterbury.ac.nz/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=DIGI405) project at the University of Canterbury. Building the corpus (scraping/cleaning/ideating) was part of a group project, while the analysis was done individually.

The entire project consists of:
  1) A web-scraped corpus, and
  2) An analysis of the corpus to answer the **Key Question**: Do different political parties use harsher/softer language when discussing gangs?

## Dataset Information

(From the [Essay](https://github.com/kanewilliams/political_gang_discourse/blob/main/Corpus-Analysis-Essay_NZ-Parliament-and-Gangs.pdf)):

> The data consists of web-scraped New Zealand parliament transcripts, filtered to only the dialogues containing at least one of “gang*”, “mongrel mob”, and “black power”. The transcripts are then separated by speaker, and finally sorted by party. There are 585 files sorted into the National corpus, with a total word count of 384,329. There are 348 files in the Labour corpus, with a total word count of 247,191. The data is from 2003 to 2024.

## Conclusions

(From the [Essay](https://github.com/kanewilliams/political_gang_discourse/blob/main/Corpus-Analysis-Essay_NZ-Parliament-and-Gangs.pdf)):

> This paper has investigated the “Labour-Soft” thesis: that National and Labour members use different language when discussing gangs. Using Keyness between the two corpora, a collocation analysis on “gang”, and a concordance and frequency count on the keywords previously found, it has been shown that there are multiple sources of very weak to weak evidence that the thesis holds.
